# 🛒 Sales ETL & Analytics Project

## 📖 Overview

This project processes the **Online Retail II Dataset (2009–2011)** to create a clean, analysis-ready sales database. The ETL pipeline is implemented in Python, producing aggregate CSVs and a SQLite database.

The pipeline handles:

- 🧹 Data cleaning and transformation
- 💰 Revenue calculation
- 🔁 Deduplication
- 📅 Monthly aggregations
- ⭐ Top customer, top products, and revenue summaries

## ⚡ Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Packages listed in `requirements.txt`

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️⃣ Prepare Dataset

- Place `online_retail_II.xlsx` in the `data/` folder.

### 3️⃣ Run the ETL Pipeline

```bash
python etl_sales_pipeline.py
```

This will:

- 🧹 Clean and transform raw Excel data
- 💰 Calculate revenue and order month
- 📊 Generate aggregate CSVs in `data/`
- 💾 Load everything into SQLite database `db/sales.db`
- 🔎 Print sample analytics (monthly revenue, top products, top customer)

---

## 📝 Notes

- Aggregate CSVs are auto-generated from the ETL pipeline.
- You can later connect `db/sales.db` to Power BI or Tableau for visualizations.
